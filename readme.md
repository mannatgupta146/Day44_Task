# Day 44 Task | Cohort 2.0
This project is my **Day 43 Task**, where I built an **IPL Winner Guess Generator** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

It features **random team selection**, **dynamic UI colors**, **logo updates**, and a **smooth premium card design**, all powered by simple **DOM manipulation** and **event handling**.

## 📌 About the Day 43 Task  

Day 43 was centered around practicing deeper DOM concepts such as:

- Updating multiple elements dynamically  
- Changing UI colors based on data  
- Handling user interactions  
- Working with arrays of objects  
- Using images, gradients, and dynamic styling  

This task helped strengthen both **JS logic** and **frontend UI design**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML** – Base structure
* **CSS** – Styling, layout, glass effect, animations
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – DOM logic & dynamic styling
* **VS Code / Browser** – Development & testing


## 📖 Learning Outcome

Through this task, I learned how to:

* Work with arrays of objects (team data + colors + images)
* Manipulate the DOM by changing styles, images, and text instantly
* Handle click events and dynamic color changes
* Apply **glassmorphism**, shadows, and responsive UI design
* Use random number generation for interactive elements
* Build a smooth premium UI with **animations + transitions**

This project improved my confidence in creating **interactive JavaScript-based UI components**.


## 🌟 Acknowledgement

This task helped me grow in **frontend development**, especially in understanding dynamic styling and interactive UI logic.
Thanks for the guidance and consistent motivation that helps me push further every day.
